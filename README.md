![TeamAlpha](https://github.com/GMCADevops/DevopsProject3/blob/Documentation/images/teamAlpha.png)

This is a group challenge to see what we can produce and how well we can apply the knowledge we have gained over the last 12 weeks, as well as gaining experience working to complete a deliverable as part of a team which will be invaluable experience for future roles.

## Scope
In short, we are expected to deploy the following applications:

https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-angular

https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-rest

They are well documented applications for the ‘Spring Pet Clinic’ domain, one of which serves as a front end client using AngularJS and the other as an API using Java.

## Requirements
